# ng-conf NgRx Test 2021

The countries are loaded by selecting a region - either Asia or Europe 

which should be loadeed as a dropdown 

Selecting a country displays its data in a table at the bottom

Name | Capital | Population| Currencies as a string array | Flag (as an image)



Have added Strict Runtime checks to the AppModule

There are no tests - 

Simple CSS has been used although normally I will use SCSS



If I'd had time I'd have used an Entity Adapter and added Testing 

I'd also have used the Devtools to see the Time Travelling Debugger



## Setup

```sh
yarn
```

or

```sh
npm install

## Running the app

```sh

or

```sh
npm start
